F5 LBaaS Community Edition Support Policy
 
The Community Edition of the F5 LBaaS Plug-in is Free Software
available under the Apache License version 2.0, and is 
provided without Warranty or Support under existing support 
contracts for F5 products. The Community Edition is distinct 
from our Commercial Edition which will be available as part 
of the BIG-IQ product in the near future. Support will be 
available for our Commercial Edition.
 
F5 LBaaS Community Edition Frequently Asked Questions
  
Q: Does Community Support mean customers are completely on our own?

A: There will be developers and other members of the F5 community
   who will be willing to help you resolve problems. However, help
   will be provided on a best-effort basis and it is possible your
   problem may not be resolved quickly. 

   While DevCentral and Launchpad community is are world-wide, 
   you should not rely on anyone being available at a particular time,
   especially outside business hours.

   The F5 OpenStack DevCentral site can be found at:

      https://devcentral.f5.com/openstack

   The F5 OpenStack Launchpad site can be found at:

Q: If I have a problem with the LBaaS plug-in in the middle
   of the night, who do I call?

A: F5 Phone Support is not available for the Community Edition.
   However, please consider that the function on the plug-in is
   to help configure your BIG-IPs â€“ a job you would have to do
   yourself in the absence of the free plug-in. Therefore, to 
   mitigate the risk of something going wrong with the free 
   plug-in you will need to develop the expertise to configure
   the BIG-IP manually in case you need to do so in a time-critical
   situation. The F5 LBaaS plug-in ONLY uses publicly documented
   F5 iControl APIs.
 
 
Q: If I have a problem in the middle of the night with a 
   Virtual Server or Monitor on BIG-IP that was configured by the
   LBaaS plug-in, who do I call?

A: Using the F5 LBaaS plug-in does not invalidate your BIG-IP Support
   contract. If you are having trouble with the operation of your BIG-IP,
   such as a VIP not passing traffic, those types of problems are 
   still supported.
 
 
Q: If I have identified a bug or developed improvement, 
   how can I submit that for incorporation into the plug-in?

A: The site on F5 Dev Central https://devcentral.f5.com/openstack is
   available to facilitate discussions and accept suggestions. 
   Also, a Launchpad site at https://devcentral.f5.com/openstack
   is available for bug reporting.
 
 
Q: Why aren't you providing phone support?

A: F5 will be providing support for our Commercial Edition in 
   conjunction with the BIG-IQ product. The Commercial Edition 
   may have constraints on what distributions, versions, and 
   configurations are supported in order to ensure quality of 
   the overall solution. For the Community Edition, there are 
   no such constraints. Given that OpenStack is a rapidly evolving 
   technology, there are various versions, customizations, and 
   flavors of plug-ins that can be used with OpenStack. Also, 
   we anticipate that the Community LBaaS plug-in may be modified
   by customers for their own purposes. Under these conditions,
   and considering that the plug-in is free, it is not practical
   for F5 Support to accept the burden of making the plug-in work
   in every possible OpenStack deployment scenario.
 
Q: How and When can I get access to the Commerical Edition 
   of the plugin with BIG-IQ?

A: F5 will be making the Commercial Edition of the F5 LBaaS plug-in
   for OpenStack available in the next release of BIG-IQ, which is 
   scheduled for general availability in the Summer of 2014. When the 
   F5 LBaaS Plugin-In is used in conjunction with a purchased license
   for BIG-IQ, the plug-in will have full F5 product support - within 
   the constraints of the supported OpenStack, BIG-IP and BIG-IQ versions. 
   For Early Access to the Commercial Edition of the F5 LBaaS plugin 
   with BIG-IQ, please submit a request for access to the F5 Early 
   Access Program - specifically BIG-IQ at:
