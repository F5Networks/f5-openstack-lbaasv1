Build
-----
Creating packages requires that docker engine being installed and running
on the build machine. Instructions on how to accomplish this are located at
https://docs.docker.com.

Debian Packages
```````````````
Specify the docker_debs makefile target to build debian packages for the
Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (Trusty) release.

.. code-block:: shell

    $ make docker_debs

Packages are built in the following directory:

::

    ./build/deb_dist


RPM Packages
````````````
Specify the docker_el7_rpms makefile target to build RPM packages for the
CentOS/RedHat 7 release.

.. code-block:: shell

    $ make docker_el7_rpms

Packages are built in the following directory:

::

    ./build/el7


Specify the docker_el6_rpms makefile target to build RPM packages for the
CentOS/RedHat 6 release.

.. code-block:: shell

    $ make docker_el6_rpms

Packages are built in the following directory:

::

    ./build/el6


All Packages
````````````
Specify the package makefile target to build packages for all supported
releases.

.. code-block:: shell

    $ make package

PyPI
----
To make a PyPI package...

.. code-block:: shell

    python setup.py sdist

Test
----
Before you open a pull request, your code must have passing
`pytest <http://pytest.org>`__ unit tests. In addition, you should
include a set of functional tests written to use a real BIG-IPÂ® device
for testing. Information on how to run our set of tests is included
below.

Unit Tests
``````````
We use pytest for our unit tests.

#. If you haven't already, install the required test packages and the
   requirements.txt in your virtual environment.

   .. code-block:: shell

       $ pip install hacking pytest pytest-cov
       $ pip install -r requirements.txt


#. Run the tests and produce a coverage repor. The ``--cov-report=html`` will
   create a ``htmlcov/`` directory that you can view in your browser
   to see the missing lines of code.

   .. code-block:: shell

       py.test --cov ./icontrol --cov-report=html
       open htmlcov/index.html

Style Checks
````````````
We use the hacking module for our style checks (installed as part of
step 1 in the Unit Test section).

    .. code-block:: shell

        $ flake8 ./
