One-Arm Mode
````````````

In a one-arm deployment, BIG-IPÂ® has a single (hence, one-arm) connection to the router. VIPs and members are provisioned from a single Neutron subnet. Use of SNATs is required; you can opt to either allocate SNAT addresses automatically, or specify a number of SNAT addresses to make available from the subnet's existing IP address pool (``f5_snat_addresses_per_subnet``).
