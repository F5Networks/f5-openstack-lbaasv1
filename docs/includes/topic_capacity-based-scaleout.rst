Environment Grouping and Capacity-Based Scale Out
`````````````````````````````````````````````````

When using service differentiated environments, the environment can be scaled out to multiple BIG-IP速 device service groups by providing an ``environment_group_number`. Each agent associated with a specific device service group should have the same ``environment_group_number``. When environment grouping is configured, the service provider scheduler will consider the grouping along with an ``environment_capacity_score`` reported by the agents. Together, the agent grouping and the capacity score allow the scheduler to scale out a single environment across multiple BIG-IP速 device service groups.

    # When using service differentiated environments, the environment can be
    # scaled out to multiple device service groups by providing a group number.
    # Each agent associated with a specific device service group should have
    # the same environment_group_number.
    #
    # environment_group_number = 1
    #

Each agent measures its group's capacity. The agent reports a single ``environment_capacity_score`` for its group every time it reports its status to the Neutron controller.

The ``environment_capacity_score`` value is the highest capacity recorded on several collected statistics specified in the ``capacity_policy`` setting in the agent configuration. The ``capacity_policy`` setting is a dictionary, where the key is the metric name and the value is the max allowed value for that metric. The score is determined by dividing the metric collected by the max specified for that metric in the ``capacity_policy`` setting. An acceptable reported ``environment_capacity_score`` is between zero (0) and one (1). **If an agent in the group reports an ``environment_capacity_score`` of one (1) or greater, the device is considered to be at capacity.**

When multiple ``environment_group_number``-designated groups of agents are available, and a service is created where the services' tenant is not already associated with a group, the scheduler will try to assign the service to the group with the last recorded ``lowest environment_capacity_score``. If the services' tenant was associated with an agent where the ``environment_group_number`` for all agents in the group are above capacity, the new service will be associated with another group where capacity is under the limit.

.. warning::

    If you set the ``capacity_policy`` and all agents in all groups for an environment are at capacity, services will no longer be scheduled. When pools are created for an environment which has no capacity left, the pools will be placed in the error state.


The following metrics implemented by the iControl速 driver can be configured in :file:`/etc/neutron/f5-oslbaasv1-agent.ini`. These settings are used to manage your environment groups / BIG-IP速 device service groups.
