For the Neutron network topologies requiring dynamic L2 and L3
provisioning of the BIG-IP速 devices -- **which includes all network topologies
except global routed mode** -- the F5速 LBaaSv1 iControl速 driver supports the following:

-  Provider VLANs - VLANs defined by the admin tenant and shared with other tenants
-  Tenant VLANs - VLANs defined by the admin tenant *for* other tenants, or defined
   by the tenants themselves
-  Tenant GRE Tunnels - GRE networks defined by the tenant
-  Tenant VxLAN Tunnels - VxLAN networks defined by the tenant
